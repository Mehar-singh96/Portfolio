This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and my projects which I completed to gain some hands-on experience in the software development and data science domain.


Halifax Public Library SQL Application - github[https://github.com/Mehar-singh96/Halifax_Public_Library_PHP_SQL_Application.git]

The project was focused to improve the existing database design of the library. The library had three immediate plans: To record all articles for each magazine, to record transaction history, to record monthly expenses. A backend data management system was created using relational database structure. A front end system was created for library administrative staff. The skills used in this project are: SQL, MongoDB, RDBMS, Python, PHP.
