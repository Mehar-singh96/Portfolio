This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and my projects which I completed to gain some hands-on experience in the software development and data science domain.


Halifax Public Library SQL Application - [github](https://github.com/Mehar-singh96/Halifax_Public_Library_PHP_SQL_Application.git)

The project was focused to improve the existing database design of the library. The library had three immediate plans: To record all articles for each magazine, to record transaction history, to record monthly expenses.

Car Rental Web Application - [Website](https://ellitecarrental20191214034251.azurewebsites.net/)

The Elite Car Rental Project allows the user to book car by adding their pickup date. The user is supposed to create its profile once by providing its information like name, contact number and driver’s licence. While booking the car the system matches the user’s location and all the filter options entered by the user. It then provides all the possible car options available at that date. Once the booking is completed the user also gets an option to modify the booking. 
The skills used in this project are : C#, .NET, MVC framework, HTML, AJAX, CSS, Bootstrap
